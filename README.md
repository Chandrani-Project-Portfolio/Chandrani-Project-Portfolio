👋 Hi, I'm Chandrani Das

🎯 Business Analyst | Data Analytics | Process Excellence | Organizational Psychology

💡 I'm a curious mind- blending process thinking, psychological insight, and data-driven decision-making to drive business transformation and people development. I’m a data-driven professional with 4.7 years of experience. 

I specialize in turning raw data into strategic decisions using tools like Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Excel.

My foundation in organizational psychology enhances my stakeholder management and communication, enabling me to deliver solutions that are not only data-backed but also people-centric.

🔍 Currently exploring opportunities in Business Analysis, Project Management, Quality Control — where human behavior meets operational excellence.
